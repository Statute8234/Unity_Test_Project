This is a Unity test that will share files with a GitHub repository. 

This Unity project is a top-down 2D project that is heavily inspired by the game called "Rimworld" (Ludeon Studios, October 17, 2018). Although this game does not have any objectives as of yet, it does have basic human movement, character movement, and *map generation. Perlein noise generates the background map and will generate the environmental elements. The a-star pathfinding algorithm is programmed to follow the black square (the player if the player presses or holds the left mouse button down). To deactivate this option, click on the human and reclick to activate. Camera movement is activated when you click and hold the right mouse button and move the mouse very slowly. Use the mouse scroll wheel to move the mouse up and down. 




What I need to fix:

* Change the camera's movement speed.

* Modify map generation to include environmental elements.




What to add next: 

* Include animals and randomize their movements.
